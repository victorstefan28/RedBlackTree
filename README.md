# RedBlackTree

Implementation of self-balancing bst -> red black tree. 

A red-black tree has to meet the following requirements: 
-Have every node either red or black.
-All null/nil nodes are black.
-A red node must not have a red child.
-Every path from a node to any descendent must have the same no of black nodes.
-In this implementation, the root is always black.

Serach, insert, delete -> O(logn) time complexity, n is the number of elements in the rb tree.
